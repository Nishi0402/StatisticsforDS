Data Exploration

A summary of the dataset's structure, including columns and data types.
Descriptive statistics to understand the key features.
Data Visualization

Visual representations of key variables:
Boxplot for the distribution of median house values (MEDV).
Bar plot for houses along the Charles River (CHAS).
Boxplot for MEDV against the age groups of properties.
Statistical Testing

T-test to assess the difference in median house values based on proximity to the Charles River.
ANOVA to investigate differences in median values for different age groups.
Correlation Analysis

Pearson correlation to evaluate the relationship between nitric oxide concentrations (NOX) and non-retail business acres (INDUS).
Regression Analysis

Regression analysis to understand the impact of weighted distances to employment centers (DIS) on median house values.
Interpretation
T-test Results

No significant difference in median house values for properties bounded by the Charles River compared to those not bounded.
ANOVA Results

No statistical significance in median house values among different age groups.
Correlation Analysis

Strong positive correlation (0.76) between nitric oxide concentrations and non-retail business acres.
Regression Analysis

Weak correlation (R-squared = 0.062) between weighted distances to employment centers and median house values.
